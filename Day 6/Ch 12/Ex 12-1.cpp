/*
 * Raymond Rowland
 * 30AUG21
 * Ex 12-1
 * Modify the product sales program that uses an array to store sales data.
 * - Define a constant to be used as a size declarator for an array that can store up to 12 elements
 * - Replace the vector names sales with an array and initialize the elements of the array with the default value for a double type
 * - Define a variable named sales_count that can be used to count the number of sales entries snf initialize this variable to 0
 * - Modify while loop so it will not accept more entries than the array can store
 * - Modify the code that is executed for valid sales entries so the sales amount is stored in the next element in the array and the sales_count variable is increased by one
 * - Modify the code that checks if sales were entered so it works for the modified code
 * - Modify the code that calculates the average sales and displays the number of sales entries so it uses the sales_count variable
